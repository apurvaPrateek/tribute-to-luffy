            <h3>Earning A Bounty Of 1.5 Billion Berries</h3>
            <p>
              There are innumerable pirates in the One Piece world. However, the
              pirates are differentiated into the weak and the strong. The truly
              strong pirates, whose names and actions can truly cause an upheaval in
              the pirating world of One Piece, have bounties of over a billion.
      
              <br />
      
              This is why Luffy getting a bounty of 1.5 billion berries was such a big
              deal to the characters in the series and fans alike. After getting a 1.5
              billion berry bounty, Luffy was unofficially dubbed the 5th Emperor of
              the Sea, becoming a big shot alongside other Emperors such as Kaido, Big
              Mum, Shanks, and Blackbeard.

            <h3>Defeating Katakuri</h3>
            <p>
              Katakuri, Big Mom's second-in-command and self-described "sweet
              commander of flour," is a highly dangerous individual. Defeating
              Katakuri, the man with a billion berries bounty on his head, was a
              monumental challenge, but one that Luffy had to take on if he wanted to
              continue on his path to becoming the pirate king.
              <br />
              Because Katakuri was the most powerful of Big Mom's children, Luffy had
              to improve his strength significantly. Because of his enhanced haki of
              observation, he was able to predict the future. Amazingly, Luffy was
              able to overcome the affable commander in a single night, despite
              Katakuri having spent years learning his craft.

            <h3>Getting A Rookie's Recognition From Whitebeard</h3>
            <p>
              The infamous pirate Whitebeard, whose real name was Edward Newgate, was
              one of the few who could challenge the reign of Gol D. Roger. The mere
              mention of Whitebeard's name or the doing of any deed by him would cause
              a ruckus.
              <br />
              When attempting to rescue Portgas D. Ace, Luffy's sworn, brother and
              Whitebeard's adopted son, Luffy, and Whitebeard crossed paths during the
              One Piece series' Marineford arc. Whitebeard recognized Luffy's talent
              and acknowledged the rookie pirate's challenge to show him what the
              future will look like because of his perseverance, willpower, and
              potential.

            <h3>Being The Only Man To Successfully Attack Enies Lobby</h3>
            <p>
              Enies Lobby was one of the three major islands of the world government.
              It was a judicial island where criminals were judged for their crimes
              before being sent to the prison Impel Down or the Marine headquarters.
              In the Enies Lobby arc of One Piece, Luffy and his crew were responsible
              for infiltrating the judicial island to retrieve Nico Robin, their
              nakama.
              <br />
              As a great battle ensued between the Straw Hat Pirates and CP9 (a secret
              government agency whose headquarters was set on Enies Lobby), Enies
              Lobby suffered disastrous attacks and was eventually destroyed by the
              Buster Call, a terrifying attack meant to eliminate the Straw Hat
              Pirates and their allies. However, Luffy and his crew survived unscathed
              and became the first ones to successfully attack the government island.

            <h3>Mastering Advanced Conqueror's Haki In A Night</h3>
            <p>
              Conqueror's Haki is an extremely rare version of Haki in the One Piece
              anime series. It is not something that can be acquired; people are
              either born with it or without it. With Conqueror's Haki, the user can
              briefly knock out opponents who have weaker willpower. Conqueror's Haki
              is employed for more than just intimidating opponents, despite its
              excellent benefits.
              <br />
              In its refined form, known as advanced conquering haki, the haki can be
              directly incorporated into attacks, greatly enhancing their destructive
              potential. The most devastating of Roger and Kaido's attacks are based
              on the advanced conqueror's haki. Luffy's combat prowess is on full
              display as he learns and masters advanced conqueror's haki in one
              night's time while facing off against Kaido. This was unbelievable to
              even Kaido, who had spent years training his advanced conqueror's haki.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Defeating Kaido</h3>
            <p>
              A powerful ogre named Kaido, known as the King of Beasts, had amassed a
              fortune of 4,611,100,000 berries at his zenith in the One Piece world.
              The strongest creature on Earth was how he was often described due to
              his incredible strength. Luffy had to learn to counter his haki and
              devil fruit attacks, among other techniques, because even his strongest
              gear was no match for him.
      
              <br />
      
              Even after defeating Kaido twice with his newfound skills, Luffy still
              had to work for his eventual victory. Since Luffy had just defeated an
              Emperor of the Sea in the form of Kaido, he was now among the most
              powerful figures in the One Piece universe.
            </p>

            <h3>Becoming A Yonko At The Age Of 19</h3>
            <p>
              Luffy was informally crowned the 5th Emperor of the Sea after receiving
              a reward of 1.5 billion berries. Many of the series' regulars, including
              Blackbeard, initially resented this development, believing that Luffy
              did not yet merit the title. But after he defeated Kaido, everything
              changed.
              <br />
              After Luffy's huge victory over Kaido, the World Government had no
              choice but to recognize him. They made him Emperor of the Sea and gave
              him a bounty of 3 billion berries. Fans were deeply moved by Luffy's
              elevation to the position of Emperor, especially given that he did it at
              the tender age of 19—just two years after he had first taken up
              piracy—when even the previous youngest Emperor, Shanks, had reached that
              position in his 30s.

            <h3>Unlocking Gear Fifth</h3>
            <p>
              The user's mind and body must finally catch up to the strength of the
              devil fruit before the user can experience an awakening. Even the King
              of Beasts, Kaido, has not yet awakened his devil fruit, so fans can
              imagine the difficulty involved in doing so.
              <br />
              Conversely, Luffy awoke his devil fruit during his fight with Kaido.
              Even with his superior conqueror's haki ability, Luffy was outmatched by
              Kaido until he awoke his devil fruit and was able to transform his
              environment into rubber, greatly enhancing his strength in fights.
